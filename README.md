# Utility Class Library

The **Utility Class Library** is a C++ library that provides a wide range of utility functions for common programming tasks. It is implemented as a class (`clsUtil`) and includes methods for generating random numbers, manipulating arrays, working with matrices, encrypting/decrypting text, and more. This library is designed to simplify common programming tasks and can be easily integrated into any C++ project.

1. **Random Number Generation**:
   - Generate random numbers within a specified range.
   - Generate random characters (small letters, capital letters, digits, or special characters).
   - Generate random words and keys.

2. **Array Manipulation**:
   - Fill arrays with random numbers, words, or keys.
   - Shuffle arrays.
   - Swap elements of arrays.

3. **Matrix Operations**:
   - Check if two matrices are equal.
   - Check if a matrix is an identity matrix, scalar matrix, or sparse matrix.
   - Find the minimum and maximum numbers in a matrix.
   - Check if a matrix is a palindrome matrix.

4. **Text Manipulation**:
   - Encrypt and decrypt text using a simple encryption key.
   - Print the first letter of each word in a string.
   - Capitalize the first letter of each word in a string.

5. **Mathematical Utilities**:
   - Check if a number is prime, perfect, or a palindrome.
   - Reverse a number.
   - Calculate the sum of digits of a number.

6. **Date and String Utilities**:
   - Swap dates and strings.
